# restoHack: Bringing 1984 Hack Back from the Dead

**restoHack** is a full-blooded resurrection of *Hack*, the 1984 roguelike that spawned *NetHack*.
Not a remake. Not a reboot. This is *software preservation with a blowtorch and a scalpel*.

The goal: make the original code compile, run, and dungeon-crawl exactly as it did when floppies were king.

Think resto-mod: the soul stays vintage, the internals get a precision rebuild.

**Philosophy**: "Fix what breaks, preserve what works" - authentic 1984 gameplay with modern build system and safety improvements.

**[Read the Complete History of Hack](docs/HISTORY_OF_HACK.md)**  
*From Rogue (1980) to NetHack's rise, through decades of digital decay, to restoHack's 2025 resurrection*

* **Unix/Linux Fixes** – No more hardcoded BSD paths or FS quirks.
* **Cross-Platform Verified** – Works on Linux (glibc/musl) & FreeBSD; CI-tested.

> **Tested on:** Arch, Alpine, FreeBSD 14.3, WSL, and aarch64.
> macOS support verified via runner. Arch users can install via the AUR.

## Installation

### Arch Linux (AUR)

```bash
yay -S restohack
```

### Download Pre-built Binary (Linux)

Download the static binary from [Releases](https://github.com/Critlist/restoHack/releases):

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Games/restohack
cd ~/Games/restohack
tar -xzf restoHack-*-linux-x86_64-static.tar.gz
./run-hack.sh
```

*Note: As of v1.1.1, we provide separate binary and source tarballs instead of hybrid packages.*

*(static binary, no dependencies required)*

Also available on [itch.io](https://critlist.itch.io/restohack) — no compiling required.

### Build from Source

**Requirements:** `git`, `cmake`, a C compiler, `ncurses`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Critlist/restoHack.git
cd restoHack
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
cd build && ./hack
```

**Alternative** (if your system supports CMake presets):

```bash
cmake --preset=release && cmake --build build
```

**For BSD systems, development builds, IDE integration, and troubleshooting:** see [**Build Instructions**](docs/BUILD.md)

### Windows (Work in Progress)

A `windows-port` branch exists targeting **MSVC** and **MinGW64** using **PDCurses**.

The MinGW build currently compiles but is **not yet playable**. Build system
details and testing are still in progress.

The long-term goal is a simple Windows build so people curious about early
roguelike and Hack history can experience the game without needing a Unix
terminal. A free Steam release is planned once the Windows build is stable.

## Preservation Philosophy

Fix what breaks, preserve what works.

## Source Code

Built from Andries Brouwer's Hack 1.0.3 (1985) preserved in FreeBSD's games collection. Original source in [`docs/historical/original-source/`](docs/historical/original-source/)

See [CODING_STANDARDS.md](docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md) for how changes are documented.

Full history: [HISTORY_OF_HACK.md](docs/HISTORY_OF_HACK.md)

## Historical Research

**[protoHack](https://github.com/Critlist/protoHack)** recovers and restores Jay Fenlason's original 1981-82 source code and conducts primary-source research into Hack's origins. **restoHack** is the stabilized restoration of Brouwer's Hack 1.0.3 with curated history. The [`docs/research/`](docs/research/) directory is the shared evidence base maintained across both projects.

## Gameplay

You’re the `@`, diving into the Mazes of Menace to steal the Amulet of Yendor.
Expect monsters, magic, cursed loot, and permadeath. Controls are Vi-style (`hjkl`). Survival is… unlikely.

---

## Contributing

Bug fixes, portability patches, packaging help—welcome.
Want to port to Plan 9? Go for it. Just document changes and respect the code.
